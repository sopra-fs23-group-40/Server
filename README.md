# SoPra FS23 Group 40 - TacBlock

## Introduction
### Motivation
Our idea was to create a game that would be fun to play, which keeps us motivated for the whole semester.
We decided to create "TacBlock", which is similar as the original game ["Blokus" from Bernard Tavitian](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blokus), but as a nice online game version.

### Game Mechanism
The game is played by 4 players, who have to place their blocks on the board. The goal is to place as many blocks as possible. The game ends when no player can place any more blocks on the board. The winner is the player with the most blocks on the board.
You can find a "Rules" section in the game, which explains the game in more detail.

## Technologies
- We use **Java** as the main programming Language for the Server.
- With **REST** endpoints, the Clients can interact with the Server, which is programmed with **Spring**.
- We use **JPA for persistance**.
- The Server is built with **Gradle**.
- Both Server and Client are deployed on **Google Cloud** and the code is stored **GitHub**. 
- **SonarCloud** checks our code every time we push to GitHub and deploy it.

_For the Client's technologies, please refer to the Client's README.md._  

## High-level components
- [GameController](https://github.com/sopra-fs23-group-40/Server/blob/82c3c9270faf1c4d1248ab908bfd863c221cc905/src/main/java/ch/uzh/ifi/hase/soprafs23/controller/GameController.java), [LobbyController](https://github.com/sopra-fs23-group-40/Server/blob/82c3c9270faf1c4d1248ab908bfd863c221cc905/src/main/java/ch/uzh/ifi/hase/soprafs23/controller/LobbyHandler.java), [UserController](https://github.com/sopra-fs23-group-40/Server/blob/82c3c9270faf1c4d1248ab908bfd863c221cc905/src/main/java/ch/uzh/ifi/hase/soprafs23/controller/UserController.java) for REST Endpoints
- [Game](https://github.com/sopra-fs23-group-40/Server/blob/82c3c9270faf1c4d1248ab908bfd863c221cc905/src/main/java/ch/uzh/ifi/hase/soprafs23/game/Game.java) for the game logic
- [UserService](https://github.com/sopra-fs23-group-40/Server/blob/82c3c9270faf1c4d1248ab908bfd863c221cc905/src/main/java/ch/uzh/ifi/hase/soprafs23/service/UserService.java) for the user creation and handling

## Launch & Deployment
### How to run the application
1. Clone the repository and navigate in the terminal to its location
2. With the command `./gradlew build`, the project will be built<br>
   _Alternatively, you can right-click the build.gradle in your IDE and select "Build Module 'Server'"._
3. With the command `./gradlew bootRun`, the project will be run<br>
   _Alternatively, you can right-click the build.gradle in your IDE and select "Run 'Server'"._
4. The server is now running on localhost:8080
- To run only the tests, use the command `./gradlew test`
- To exclude tests when building, use the command `./gradlew build -xtest`

### How to deploy the application
1. To deploy the application, push it to the main branch of the GitHub repository.
2. The application will be automatically deployed on Google Cloud and checked by SonarCloud.
3. The server is now deployed on http://sopra-fs23-group-40-server.oa.r.appspot.com.<br>
   _(the Client will be deployed on http://sopra-fs23-group-40-client.oa.r.appspot.com)_

_Please note that Google Cloud checks are very strict. 
It is possible that the deployment fails for example because of unused import statements,
so make sure to chat that beforehand._
